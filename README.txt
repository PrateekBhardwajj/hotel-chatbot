Restaurant Chatbot**This is bold text**
This project implements a Restaurant Chatbot which interacts with users to help them make reservations, view the menu, and ask general queries. The chatbot is built using Dialogflow for natural language understanding and integrates with a backend built with FastAPI. The backend connects to a MySQL database to retrieve restaurant data. The frontend of the website is created using HTML and CSS to provide a user-friendly interface.

Features
Dialogflow Chatbot: The chatbot uses Dialogflow for natural language processing to understand user queries.
FastAPI Backend: FastAPI is used to handle requests, process data, and interact with the MySQL database.
MySQL Database: Stores restaurant data like menus, reservations, etc.
HTML/CSS Frontend: A simple yet elegant interface for the user to interact with the chatbot.
Ngrok: Exposes the FastAPI backend to the internet for Dialogflow webhook integration.

Technologies Used(larf
Dialogflow: For creating the conversational interface.
FastAPI: For building the API that serves the chatbot and connects to the database.
MySQL: For storing restaurant data (menus, reservations, etc.).
HTML/CSS: For building the frontend of the chatbot interface.
Ngrok: For exposing the local FastAPI server to the internet.

Usage
Users can interact with the chatbot by asking questions like "Show me the menu," "Make a reservation for tomorrow," or "What's the price of the burger?"
The FastAPI backend retrieves data from the MySQL database and sends it back to the frontend, which is displayed through the chatbot.
Dialogflow's webhook is configured to forward requests to your FastAPI backend via Ngrok.

Future Improvements
Authentication: Add user authentication to manage reservations and user profiles.
Integration with external services: Integrate payment gateways or third-party services for ordering food.
Improve frontend: Enhance the UI/UX of the website and chatbot interface.
Expand Dialogflow intents: Add more conversational capabilities, such as handling user feedback or giving special offers.
